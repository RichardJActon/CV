Footnotes {data-icon=sticky-note}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scoring system* - A subjective assessment of my own skill level. __5__ is ~ daily use of the language, extensive knowledge of its ecosystem as well as deep knowledge of its structure and experience of developing production apps in that language. __1__ is occasional use with heavy reliance of reference material but with at least one real world task such as creating a website or pipline accomplished using that tool.
